# Strategy Evaluation Results for the Game "Thirty with Dice"

This repository contains the results of evaluating three different strategies for a dice-based game called "30 with Dice." Each strategy was tested over 10 million turns to determine the likelihood of achieving positive, neutral, or negative outcomes.

## Strategy Descriptions

- **Strategy A**: Only take 6's or the largest die.
- **Strategy B**: Only take 6's, 5's, or the largest die.
- **Strategy C**: Only take 6's, the largest die, or (if it's the last two dice) take both if the total is over 30.

## Results

### Evaluating Strategy A
- **Percentage chance of staying neutral or being positive**: 55.6925%
- **Percentage chance of staying neutral**: 12.9119%
- **Percentage chance of being positive**: 42.7806%
- **Percentage chance of being negative**: 44.3075%

### Evaluating Strategy B
- **Percentage chance of staying neutral or being positive**: 55.7030%
- **Percentage chance of staying neutral**: 12.8883%
- **Percentage chance of being positive**: 42.8146%
- **Percentage chance of being negative**: 44.2970%

### Evaluating Strategy C
- **Percentage chance of staying neutral or being positive**: 58.2356%
- **Percentage chance of staying neutral**: 11.3377%
- **Percentage chance of being positive**: 46.8979%
- **Percentage chance of being negative**: 41.7644%

## Summary

The results indicate that **Strategy C** is the most effective in increasing the chance of a positive outcome while reducing the likelihood of a negative outcome. This strategy's additional rule of taking both dice if their combined value exceeds 30 in the final roll significantly impacts the overall success rate in the game "30 with Dice."
